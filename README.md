This repository includes all code and data which is used for the manuscript of the same name (https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04560). It is written in a Jupyter notebook in Julia 1.11.1. The Jupyter notebook "Nonlinear-Eliashberg-theory" is the main file, it uses the functions "T_crit.jl", "Im_bandgap.jl", "Re_bandgap.jl" and "Re_bandgap_fast.jl". All SVG files are the figures which are already generated and used in the manuscript. The files without .domain (T_c, Im_sol, Re_sol, ...) are the raw data which is generated by the code. Explanation of the notebook is written in the notebook itself. For further questions you can email me.
